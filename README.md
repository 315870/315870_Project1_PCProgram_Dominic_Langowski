PART RATIONALE: CPU - I picked the i3 CPU because it's the 9th generation of Intel's CPUs. i3 is the latest available and the most cost-effective for the given budget. If the budget was bigger I would have chosen the i5, or maybe even i7 or i9. Motherboard - The motherboard selected is compatible with all 9th generation Intel CPUs. Not the best motherboard but the most cost-effective for compatibility.  RAM - DDR4 is compatible with motherboard. HardDrive - Solid State, 500GB which is sufficient for the operating system and any Cad software. M.2 hard drive would have been better but the budget was limited. However, upgrades in the future are welcomed  GPU - The graphics card was selected to be powerful but well-priced. Not the latest GPU but it's powerful enough for Cad software and the cost fits in the budget. GPU cooler has large fans (for power supply too) which should create a quiet work environment.  Power Supply - The power supply comes from a company known for high quality and supports all components selected.  Case - supports all components.
